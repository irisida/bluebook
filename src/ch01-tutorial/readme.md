# The Blue Book - Chapter 01 - Tutorial and introduction

- [1.2 command line arguments](/src/ch01-tutorial/102-command-line-args) - Simple program that repeats the Args that are passed to the program using the `os.Args` capabilities.
    - [exercise 1.1](/src/ch01-tutorial/102-x01) - Modifies the program to take account of `os.Args` indexes
    - [exercise 1.2](/src/ch01-tutorial/102-x02) - Modifies the program to experiment with output and uses the formatted printing options to show the index and the argument value for each arg provided.
- [1.3 finding duplicate lines](/src/ch01-tutorial/103-finding-dup-lines) - Take input from the Stdin and add to map the value and occurence count. Filter only on samples that are duplicates.
- [1.3 finding duplicate files](/src/ch01-tutorial/103-finding-dup-files) - pass in zero files and we'll use the Stdin to find duplicate values. When files are passed in it will check all the files and return a list of values which made multiple appearances in one or many files.
    - [exercise 1.4](/src/ch01-tutorial/103-finding-dup-files) - adjusted the above to list the files that a duplicate was found in.
- [1.4 Animated gifs](/src/ch01-tutorial/104-animated-gif) - example of creating an animated gif.
